    "To supplement what is going on in class related to control structures and functions, we've come up with this fun challenge to explore futher practice.  Although we're not specifically covering recursive functions, they can be useful to avoid application complexity when implenting repeating processes that test repeating conditions.  You don't have to use tehm in this exercize, but we strongly suggest you try solve the challenges using recursive methods.  \n",

    "Requirements For these challenges, you will need to have a basic working knowledge of Python and be comfortable with fundamental usage. To get the most out of these exercises you should avoid using libraries (but feel free to use buil-in types ie: zip()) as much as possible and try to construct solutions by hand as much as possible. Also, if solutions are available, try not to peek to get the most out of this. Feel free to search and use resources on the web but try to figure as much of these out with careful thought."
